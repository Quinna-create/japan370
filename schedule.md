## Important Notes

### SRS (Spaced Repetition System)
- Daily reviews are essential for retention
- Cards become "due" based on your self-assessment ratings:
  - **Again** (Red): Review in <1 day
  - **Hard** (Orange): Shorter interval
  - **Good** (Green): Standard progression
  - **Easy** (Blue): Longer interval

### Mnemonic Stories
- Create personalized stories for each kanji
- Stories are saved automatically in the app
- Good stories connect primitives with the keyword in memorable ways

### Weekly Pattern
- **Study Mode**: Learn new kanji for the week
- **Quiz Mode**: Test retention of previous week's kanji
- **SRS Review**: Daily practice of all previously learned kanji

### RTK Book 2 (Weeks 12-15)
- Frame ranges will be determined based on class progress
- Book 2 focuses on additional common-use kanji
- Will be announced by Week 10

---

## Total Kanji Coverage

- **Book 1 (Weeks 1-11):** 766 kanji
- **Book 2 (Weeks 12-15):** TBD kanji
- **Total:** ~900+ kanji by end of semester

---

## Study Tips

1. **Daily Practice**: Even 15-20 minutes daily is more effective than cramming
2. **Write Stories**: The more creative and personal, the better retention
3. **Use Primitives**: Connect kanji through shared primitive elements
4. **Stay Consistent**: Keep up with SRS reviews to avoid backlog
5. **Review Weak Cards**: Focus extra attention on "Again" ratings
